abstract: A dense reconstruction of neuronal synaptic connectivity typically
  requires high-resolution 3D electron microscopy (EM) data, but EM data alone
  lacks functional information about neurons and synapses. One approach to
  augment structural EM datasets is with the fluorescent immunohistochemical
  (IHC) localization of functionally relevant proteins. We describe a protocol
  that obviates the requirement of tissue permeabilization in thick tissue
  sections, a major impediment for correlative pre-embedding IHC and EM. We
  demonstrate the permeabilization-free labeling of neuronal cell types,
  intracellular enzymes, and synaptic proteins in tissue sections hundreds of
  microns thick in multiple brain regions while simultaneously retaining the
  ultrastructural integrity of the tissue. Finally, we explore the utility of
  this protocol by performing proof-of-principle correlative experiments
  combining two-photon imaging of protein distributions and 3D electron
  microscopy.
