abstract: Serial sectioning electron microscopy (EM) of millimeter-scale three-dimensional (3D) anatomical volumes requires the collection of thousands of ultrathin sections. Here, we report a high-throughput automated approach, GAUSS-EM (guided accumulation of ultrathin serial sections-EM), utilizing a static magnetic field to collect and densely pack thousands of sections onto individual silicon wafers. The method is capable of sectioning hundreds of microns of tissue per day at section thicknesses down to 35 nm. Relative to other automated volume EM approaches, GAUSS-EM democratizes the ability to collect large 3D EM volumes because it is simple and inexpensive to implement. We present two exemplar EM volumes of a zebrafish eye and mouse olfactory bulb collected with the method.
