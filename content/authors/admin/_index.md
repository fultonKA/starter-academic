Kara Fulton is a neuroscientist and postdoctoral fellow at Harvard Medical School. She holds a Ph.D. in neuroscience from Brown University and a bachelors degree in mathematics from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. 

Her PhD research, conducted in the lab of Dr. Kevin Briggman at the Max Planck Institute for Neurobiology of Behavior, included developing high-throughput methods for correlative electron microscopy and investigating the functional and structural wiring specificity of interneurons in the mouse olfactory bulb. Currently as a Tan Yang Fellow, she is interested in understanding how neural circuits process sensory information and coordinate movement in a way that ultimately facilitates exploration. Her research interests broadly include neuroethology, sensory neuroscience, and correlative electron microscopy.

She enjoys mentoring the next generation of scientists and is committed to training students from under-represented backgrounds in STEM.
