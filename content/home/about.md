Kara Fulton is a neuroscientist and postdoctoral fellow at Harvard Medical School in the laboratory of [Dr. Bob Datta](datta.hms.harvard.edu). She holds a Ph.D. in neuroscience from Brown University and a bachelors degree in mathematics from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. Her research interests include neuroethology, sensory neuroscience, and correlative microscopy.

Her PhD research, conducted in the lab of Dr. Kevin Briggman at the Max Planck Institute for Neurobiology of Behavior - CAESAR in Germany, included developing methods for correlative electron microscopy and high-throughput serial section collection. She used these techniques to generate a dense connectomic reconstruction of the interneurons in the mouse olfactory bulb to investigate the functional and structural wiring specificity of cells underlying olfactory computations. Her dissertation demonstrates how structure underlies function within an olfactory circuit using a combination of cellular-resolution protein expression of neuronal cell types with synaptic connectivity, physiology and computational modeling.

She is devoted to mentorship and is committed to training students from under-represented backgrounds in STEM. She is active with Skype a Scientist and serves as an advisor to undergraduates and high school students interested in a career in neuroscience through the Simply Neuroscience Advising Program.
