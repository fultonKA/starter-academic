Kara Fulton is a neuroscientist and postdoctoral fellow at Max Planck-affiliated Research Center [caesar](caesar.de) in Bonn, Germany. She holds a Ph.D. in neuroscience from Brown University and a bachelors degree in mathematics from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. 

As a postdoctoral fellow in the laboratory of [Dr. Kevin Briggman](https://www.caesar.de/en/research/groups/computational-neuroethology/research-focus.html), she investigates the functional and structural wiring specificity of interneurons in the mouse olfactory bulb. During her graduate studies, Dr. Fulton generated the first dense reconstruction of a mammalian olfactory circuit using correlative light and electron microscopy. She aims to combine cellular-resolution protein expression of neuronal cell types with synaptic connectivity and physiology in order to generate network-level computational models of brain circuits.

Dr. Fulton is an incoming postdoctoral fellow in the laboratory of [Dr. Bob Datta](datta.hms.harvard.edu) at Harvard Medical School in 2021.
